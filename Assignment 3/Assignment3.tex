\item Question 1
  \begin{enumerate}
    % Answer to 1.1
    \item
    The open-loop step response of the system is shown in the Simulink model (Figure \ref{fig:figure1_1}) below with the response shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_2}.

    To identify the gain and time constant for this system, we can rearrange the transfer function to isolate the gain K and time constant $\tau$:

    The given transfer function is:
    \[
    G_p(s) = \frac{6}{s + 2}
    \]

    To express this in the standard first-order form, which is:
    \[
    G(s) = \frac{K}{\tau s + 1}
    \]
    where \( K \) is the gain and \( \tau \) is the time constant.

    We rearrange \( G_p(s) \) as follows:
    \[
    G_p(s) = \frac{6}{2(\frac{1}{2}s + 1)} = \frac{3}{\frac{1}{2}s + 1}
    \]

    Thus, we identify the gain \( K \) and the time constant \( \tau \) as:
    \[
    K = 3, \quad \tau = \frac{1}{2}
    \]

    % Answer to 1.3
    \item 
    The Simulink model is shown below in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_4}. The response of the system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_5}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/Models/model1_3.png}
      \caption{Simulink model of the closed-loop feedback control with a proportional controller}

      \label{fig:figure1_5}
    \end{figure}

    % Answer to 1.4
    \item
    The closed-loop transfer function \( T(s) \) is given by:
    \[
    T(s) = \frac{Y'(s)}{R'(s)} = \frac{G_c(s)G_p(s)}{1 + G_c(s)G_p(s)}
    \]

    Where \( G_c(s) = K_c = 4 \) (proportional controller) and \( G_p(s) = \frac{6}{s+2} \) (plant transfer function). Substituting the transfer functions:
    \[
    T(s) = \frac{4 \cdot \frac{6}{s+2}}{1 + 4 \cdot \frac{6}{s+2}}
    \]

    Simplifying:
    \[
    T(s) = \frac{\frac{24}{s+2}}{1 + \frac{24}{s+2}} = \frac{24}{s+2+24} = \frac{24}{s+26}
    \]

    Thus, the closed-loop transfer function is:
    \[
    T(s) = \frac{24}{s+26}
    \]

    We then apply the Final Value Theorem, which states that:
    \[
    \lim_{t \to \infty} y(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} sY(s)
    \]

    For a unit step input \( R'(s) = \frac{1}{s} \), the Laplace transform of the output is:
    \[
    Y'(s) = T(s)R'(s) = \frac{24}{s+26} \cdot \frac{1}{s}
    \]

    Applying the FVT:
    \[
    \lim_{t \to \infty} y(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} s \cdot \frac{24}{(s+26)s} = \lim_{s \to 0} \frac{24}{s+26} = \frac{24}{26} = \frac{12}{13} \approx 0.923
    \]

    The steady-state value of the output is approximately \( 0.923 \). Since the system is operating on displacement from a rock assembly with a step input, the set point is 1. Thus, the offset of this system is approximately \( 0.923 \). Referring to the step response in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_5}, we can see the offset is approximately \( 1 - 0.923 = 0.077\).

    % Answer to 1.5
    \item
    The closed-loop system for controller gains $K_c = {0.25, 1, 2, 4, 10}$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_6}. Observing the results, we can see that the offset of the system decreases as the proportional gain increases.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_5.png}
      \caption{Closed-loop step response for different controller gains}
      \label{fig:figure1_6}
    \end{figure}

    % Answer to 1.6
    \item
    We want to find the controller gain \(K_c\) such that the offset is less than 0.08. The offset is given by:

    \[
    \text{Offset} = \lim_{t \to \infty} (r(t) - y(t))
    \]

    Using the Final Value Theorem:

    \[
    \text{Offset} = \lim_{s \to 0} \left(1 - \frac{K_c \cdot G_p}{1 + K_c \cdot G_p}\right)
    \]

    With \(G_p = \frac{6}{s+2}\), we evaluate at \(s=0\):

    \[
    \text{Offset} = 1 - \frac{K_c \cdot \frac{6}{0+2}}{1 + K_c \cdot \frac{6}{0+2}} = 1 - \frac{3K_c}{1 + 3K_c}
    \]

    We require that the offset be less than 0.08:

    \[
    0.08 > 1 - \frac{3K_c}{1 + 3K_c}
    \]

    Rearranging the inequality:

    \[
    \frac{3K_c}{1 + 3K_c} > 1 - 0.08 = 0.92
    \]

    \[
    3K_c > 0.92(1 + 3K_c)
    \]

    \[
    K_c > 3.8333...
    \]

    Therefore, the controller gain \(K_c\) must be greater than approximately 3.83 to achieve an offset less than 0.08.

    % Answer to 1.7
    \item
    We change from the proportional controller to the proportional-integral controller by adjusting the transfer function \(G_c(s)\) to include an integral term. The transfer function for the PI controller is given by:

    \[
    G_c(s) = K_c \left(1 + \frac{1}{\tau_I s}\right)
    \]

    Where \(K_c = 3\) and \(\tau_I = 0.05\).  The response of the system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_7}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_7.png}
      \caption{Closed-loop step response with a PI controller}
      \label{fig:figure1_7}
    \end{figure}

    % Answer to 1.8
    \item
    Given the below two transfer functions in our system:

    \[
    G_c = K_c \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\tau_I s} \right)
    \]

    \[
    G_p = \frac{6}{s+2} = \frac{K_p}{\tau_p s + 1}
    \]

    where,

    \[
    K_p = 3, \quad \tau_p = \frac{1}{2}, \quad K_c = 3, \quad \tau_I = 0.05
    \]

    Together, the closed-loop transfer function for the system becomes:

    \[
    \frac{Y'(s)}{R'(s)} = \frac{\tau_I s + 1}{\frac{\tau_I \tau_p}{K_c K_p} s^2 + \tau_I \frac{(1 + K_c K_p)}{K_c K_p} s + 1}
    \]

    We can use the equations as presented in the lecture to calculate the time constant \( \tau \) and the damping factor \( \zeta \).

    \[
    \tau = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_I \tau_p}{K_c K_p}} = \sqrt{\frac{(0.05)(\frac{1}{2})}{(3)(3)}}
    = \sqrt{0.00278}
    \]

    \[
    \tau \approx 0.0527
    \]

    \[
    \zeta = \frac{1}{2} (1 + K_c K_p) \sqrt{\frac{\tau_I}{K_c K_p \tau_p}}
 = \frac{1}{2} (1 + 9) \sqrt{\frac{0.05}{(3)(3)(\frac{1}{2})}}
    \]

    \[
    \zeta \approx 0.526
    \]

    We also derive the closed-loop gain \( K \).

    \[
    K = \tau_I s + 1 = 0.05s + 1
    \]

    The calculated time constant is approximately \( \tau \approx 0.0527 \), which suggests the system should settle relatively quickly. The expected settling time, approximately \( 4\tau = 0.21s \), can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_7}, where it settles around that point. \linebreak

    The damping factor was found to be \( \zeta \approx 0.526 \), suggesting a slightly underdamped response. This means the system should exhibit small oscillations but should not overshoot excessively, as observed in the above figure. \linebreak

    The closed-loop gain is given by \( K = 0.05s + 1 \), which means the gain varies with frequency rather than being a simple constant. Evaluating it at steady-state (\( s = 0 \)), we get \( K(0) = 1 \), which confirms that the system should track a step input without steady-state error. Over time, our system approaches 1 as expected.

    % Answer to 1.9
    \item
    The closed-loop system for integral times \( \tau_I = {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2} \) are shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_8}. As the integral time decreases, the system has an increased speed of response but also a higher relative overshoot.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_9.png}
      \caption{Closed-loop step response for different integral times}
      \label{fig:figure1_8}
    \end{figure}

    From comparing the different integral time constants, we can see that \(\tau_I\) dictates in a PI controller the trade-off between response speed and stability. Small values (e.g., \(\tau_I = 0.01\)) yield fast responses but can cause excessive overshoot and oscillations. Larger values (e.g., \(\tau_I = 2\)) improve stability with less overshoot but result in slower responses. Tuning \(\tau_I\) aims to find an optimal value, like \(\tau_I = 0.4\), that balances speed and stability according to the specific process requirements. This is due to the mathematical relationship between \(\tau_I\) and the damping factor and time constant, which affect the system's response characteristics.

    % Answer to 1.10
    \item
    The surface plots are shown below in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_9} and Figure \ref{fig:figure1_10}. The surface plots show the relationship between the integral time constant \( \tau_I \) and the damping factor \( \zeta \) with the settling time and the relative overshoot.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_10a.png}
      \caption{Surface plot of settling time and integral time constant}
      \label{fig:figure1_9}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_10b.png}
      \caption{Surface plot of relative overshoot and integral time constant}
      \label{fig:figure1_10}
    \end{figure}

    The surface plots for the closed-loop time constant (\(\tau\)) and damping factor (\(\zeta\)) reveal important insights into the system's dynamics and the trade-offs between speed and stability. The time constant plot shows that \(\tau\) decreases as the proportional gain (\(K_c\)) increases, indicating a faster system response. However, very high \(K_c\) values can lead to instability, as seen in the damping factor plot. Similarly, smaller integral time constants (\(\tau_I\)) reduce \(\tau\), but overly small \(\tau_I\) can destabilize the system. The goal is to minimize \(\tau\) for a fast response while ensuring the system remains stable.

    The damping factor plot highlights that a value of \(\zeta\) close to 1 is ideal, as it represents critical damping, where the system responds quickly without oscillations. For small \(K_c\), the system is underdamped (\(\zeta < 1\)), leading to oscillations, while very large \(K_c\) results in overdamping (\(\zeta > 1\)), causing a sluggish response. Larger \(\tau_I\) values increase \(\zeta\), while smaller \(\tau_I\) reduce it, potentially leading to instability.

    To optimize the system, we aim to balance speed and stability by selecting \(K_c\) and \(\tau_I\) values that minimize \(\tau\) while keeping \(\zeta\) close to 1. From the plots, moderate \(K_c\) values (e.g., 2–4) and small-to-moderate \(\tau_I\) values (e.g., 0.5–1) are likely to achieve this balance, providing a fast and stable response.

    % Answer to 1.11
    \item
    The curve that represents the intersection between the surface $\zeta = f(K_c, \tau_I)$ and plane $\zeta = 1$. The curve is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_11}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_11.png}
      \caption{Intersection curve between the surface and plane}
      \label{fig:figure1_11}
    \end{figure}

    % Answer to 1.12
    \item
    To optimize the system, we want to choose parameters that also have the lowest closed-loop time constant, as well as having a damping factor of 1. The closed-loop time constant is thus overlayed over the Figure \ref{fig:figure1_11} in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_12}.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_12.png}
      \caption{Intersection curve between the surface and plane with the closed-loop time constant}
      \label{fig:figure1_12}
    \end{figure}

    Given the constrainst that $K_c \leq 5$, the optimal values that follows the rational above occurs in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_12} at $K_c = 5$ and $\tau_I = 0.117187$. This point represents the optimal balance between speed and stability, ensuring a fast response without oscillations.

    % Answer to 1.13
    \item
    Graphing the above optimal tuning parameters, we get the following results for y\(t\). It exhibits the system characteristics that we were optimizing for in thh previous questions -- we have the quickest response that could occur while critically damped, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_13}.

      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_13.png}
      \caption{System response with optimal tuning parameters}
      \label{fig:figure1_13}
    \end{figure}

    % Answer to 1.14
    \item With the newly added sensor, we get the following result with our previously optimized system in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_14} from the model shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_15}. Compared to the ideal scenario where there was no sensor dynamics (Figure \ref{fig:figure1_13}), the system now has more oscillations. This is due to the sensor dynamics introducing a delay in the feedback loop, causing the system to overshoot and oscillate before stabilizing.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/figure1_14.png}
      \caption{System response with sensor dynamics}
      \label{fig:figure1_14}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/Models/model1_14.png}
      \caption{Simulink model of the system with sensor dynamics}
      \label{fig:figure1_15}
    \end{figure}

    These are no longer the most optimal tuning parameters for this system. We need to reduce the oscillations while still keeping the time constant low. As we learned from lecture, we can achieve less of an overshoot by decreasing $K_c$ or increasing $\tau_I$. We can change these parameters independently of each other at each tuning iteration to isolate their effects on the system. We can then observe the system's response and adjust the parameters accordingly to achieve the desired response. \linebreak

    Initially, we decreased the $K_c$ value from 5 to 3, this reduced the overshoot by a bit but not too much. We then incremented the $tau_I$ to 0.4, which decreased the overshoot even more. $K_c$ was then reduced to just 1, where we saw minimal overshoot, however this new overshoot caused the settling time to be prolonged. To fix this, we went through one bonus tuning iteration increasing the $\tau_I$ to reduce overshoot. Overall, the best tuning parameters ended up being $K_c = 1$ and $\tau_I = 0.5$. As expected, these final tuning parameters involved decreasing $K_c$ and increasing $\tau_I$.
    
    All three + one iterations plus the original reponse is shown below in Figure \ref{fig:figure1_16}.

\item Question 2
  \begin{enumerate}
    % 2.1
    \item To assess the stability of the open-loop system, we examined the poles of the system's transfer functions derived from laplacing (true verb) the linearized model. (Figure \ref{fig:figure2_1}) shows the TFs for the system found from A2 solutions doc:
        
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/figure2_1.png}
      \caption{Transfer functions for the system.}
      \label{fig:figure2_1}
    \end{figure}

    The relevant transfer functions, based on the deviation variables, are:

    \[
    G_1(s) = \frac{\beta}{s - \alpha}, \quad
    G_2(s) = \frac{\gamma}{s - \alpha}, \quad
    G_3(s) = \frac{\delta}{s - \epsilon}, \quad
    G_4(s) = \frac{\eta}{s - \epsilon}
    \]
    
    Using MATLAB and the given reactor parameters, the following values were computed:
    
    \begin{align*}
    \alpha &= -13.606483 \\
    \beta  &= -0.013089 \\
    \gamma &= 0.400000 \\
    \delta &= 1918.753467 \\
    \epsilon &= 1.501699 \\
    \eta &= 0.006079
    \end{align*}
    
    This gives us the following pole locations:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Poles of \( G_1(s) \) and \( G_2(s) \): \( s = -13.606483 \)
        \item Poles of \( G_3(s) \) and \( G_4(s) \): \( s = 1.501699 \)
    \end{itemize}
    
    Since the poles of \( G_3(s) = \frac{T'(s)}{C_A'(s)} \) and \( G_4(s) = \frac{T'(s)}{Q'(s)} \) both have positive real parts, the temperature deviation \( T'(s) \) exhibits an unstable response in open-loop. Furthermore, from the structure of the system, the state \( T'(s) \) is an input into \( G_1(s) \), which feeds into \( C_A'(s) \). Thus, instability in \( T'(s) \) directly destabilizes \( C_A'(s) \) as well. Thus it is an unstable open-loop system.
    
    \clearpage
    % 2.2
    \item Using the TFs found in 2.1 (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2_1}), we computed the math below to find and build the block diagram (Figure \ref{fig:figure2_2}).
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figures/figure2_2.png}
      \caption{Derivation of block diagram where \( C_A'(s) \) is the output, \( C_Ao'(s) \) is the disturbance, and \( Q'(s) \) is the input determined by the controller.}
      \label{fig:figure2_2}
    \end{figure}

    % 2.3
    \item From the derived closed-loop block diagram in Figure \ref{fig:figure2_2}, the open-loop transfer function from the heat input \(Q'(s)\) to the outlet concentration \(C_A'(s)\) is:

    \[
    \frac{C_A'(s)}{Q'(s)} = \frac{G_1(s) G_4(s)}{1 - G_1(s) G_3(s)}
    \]
    
    We use the previously computed parameter values from Matlab to see what the gain will be by inspection:
    
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \beta &= -0.013089 \quad &\Rightarrow G_1(s) &= \frac{\beta}{s - \alpha} \\
    \delta &= 1918.753467 \quad &\Rightarrow G_3(s) &= \frac{\delta}{s - \epsilon} \\
    \eta &= 0.006079 \quad &\Rightarrow G_4(s) &= \frac{\eta}{s - \epsilon}
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    
    \medskip
    
    \noindent\textbf{Sign of the Numerator \(G_1 G_4\)}  
    \[
    \beta < 0, \quad \eta > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad G_1 G_4 < 0
    \]
    
    \noindent\textbf{Sign of the Denominator \(1 - G_1 G_3\)}  
    \[
    \beta < 0, \quad \delta > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad G_1 G_3 < 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - G_1 G_3 > 1
    \]
    
    \noindent\textbf{Thus:}
    \[
    \frac{C_A'(s)}{Q'(s)} = \frac{\text{negative}}{\text{positive}} = \textbf{negative}
    \]
    
    \medskip
    
    \noindent The process gain from \(Q'(s)\) to \(C_A'(s)\) is clearly negative based on the math. This implies that increasing the heat input results in a decrease in the outlet concentration \(C_A'\), which makes sense with the exothermic nature of the reaction — increasing heat raises temperature, which increases reaction rate, therefore consuming more of \(A\). Also using Matlab's dcgain function, we found the gain would be -0.000017, which helps us double check that the gain is negative.

    \item From the previous analysis in question 2.3, we found that the TF from the manipulated input \(Q'(s)\) to the controlled output \(C_A'(s)\) has a negative gain. In the feedback control system, the controller output is based on the error signal \(E(s) = R'(s) - C_A'(s)\), and the controller applies a gain \(K_C\) to compute the input to the process:
    
    \[
    Q'(s) = G_C(s) E(s) = K_C E(s)
    \]
    
    If the sign of \(K_C\) does not match the sign of the process gain, the feedback becomes positive feedback rather than negative feedback since the input \(Q'(s)\) will be proportional to the error, and continuously move the output away from setpoint, which leads to instability. This was also mentioned in class that controller gain and process gain should be the same sign. Thus, \(K_C\) should be negative.

    We can also assess the block diagram. If \(C_A'(s)\) goes above setpoint, we get that \(E(s) = R'(s) - C_A'(s) < 0\). With the negative error, we want to increase heat (positive \(Q'(s)\)), since as mentioned in question 2.3, increasing temperature will use up more of \(A\), reducing \(C_A'(s)\). To get a positive \(Q'(s)\) in this test case, the \(K_C\) must be negative.
